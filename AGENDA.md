# Homelab Project Agenda
> Active sprint: Project 2 — Multi-Tier Web Framework Infrastructure

---

## Phase 1 — Data Tier Hardening (Immediate / Blocking)

- [x] **Remediate DLP violation** in `projects/wordpress-mysql/docker-compose.yml`
  - Move `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD` out of the compose file and into an `.env` file
  - Confirm `.env` is present in `.gitignore` before committing
  - Replace inline values with `${VAR_NAME}` references

---

## Phase 2 — WordPress Presentation Layer (Next)

- [x] Add `wordpress:latest` service to the existing compose stack
- [x] Link WordPress to `wp_database` via `WORDPRESS_DB_*` environment variables (sourced from `.env`)
- [x] Mount a named volume `wp_data` for WordPress content persistence
- [x] Attach to `lab-isolated-net` (no host network exposure)
- [x] Validate end-to-end: MySQL ready → WordPress installer loads in browser

---

## Phase 3 — Ingress & Public Exposure (Upcoming)

- [x] Deploy containerized `cloudflared` as the outbound tunnel agent
- [x] Map public subdomain(s) via Cloudflare Zero Trust tunnel rules (`wp.madearlabs.com`)
- [x] Remove any direct UFW port exposure for WordPress (port 80/8080) once tunnel is live
- [x] Capture `docker network inspect lab-isolated-net` screenshot as network proof



---

## Phase 4 — CasaOS HTTPS via Caddy + Cloudflare DNS-01 (Status: Complete)
> CasaOS dashboard reachable over valid TLS at `https://casa.madearlabs.com`

- [x] Confirmed CasaOS reachable at `100.x.y.z` (Tailscale IP) on port 80
- [x] Added A record in Cloudflare: `casa.madearlabs.com` → `100.x.y.z` (DNS only, no proxy)
- [x] Installed Go (`golang-go`) and `xcaddy`
- [x] Compiled Caddy v2.11.4 with `caddy-dns/cloudflare` plugin via `xcaddy`
- [x] Moved binary to `/usr/local/bin/caddy`
- [x] Created `/etc/caddy/caddy.env` with Cloudflare API token (`chmod 600`)
- [x] Created `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` with DNS-01 TLS config and `auto_https disable_redirects`
- [x] Created `/etc/systemd/system/caddy.service` with `EnvironmentFile` pointing to `caddy.env`
- [x] Let's Encrypt certificate issued successfully for `casa.madearlabs.com`
- [x] CasaOS now accessible at `https://casa.madearlabs.com` with valid padlock

## Phase 4.5 — Cloudflare Access 2FA Enforcement (Upcoming)
> Lock down `wp.madearlabs.com` and `casa.madearlabs.com` behind Cloudflare Access with mandatory Two-Factor Authentication

- [ ] **Cloudflare Zero Trust → Settings → Authentication**
  - Enable One-time PIN (OTP) or connect an identity provider (Google / GitHub) as the IdP
  - Enforce `Require MFA` at the IdP policy level
- [ ] **Create an Access Application for `wp.madearlabs.com`**
  - Type: Self-hosted
  - Domain: `wp.madearlabs.com`
  - Session duration: `24h` (or tighten to `1h` for stricter posture)
  - Policy: Allow → Rule: Emails ending in `@madearlabs.com` (or explicit email list)
  - Enable `Purpose Justification` if audit logging is desired
- [ ] **Create an Access Application for `casa.madearlabs.com`**
  - Same IdP and MFA requirement as above
  - Domain: `casa.madearlabs.com`
  - Restrict to the same trusted email list
- [ ] **Validate end-to-end login flow**
  - Browse to `https://wp.madearlabs.com` from a clean browser session — confirm Cloudflare Access login wall appears
  - Authenticate with IdP → confirm 2FA challenge fires (TOTP code or OTP email)
  - Confirm successful passthrough to WordPress/CasaOS behind the gate
  - Repeat for `https://casa.madearlabs.com`
- [ ] **Verify bypass is impossible**
  - Confirm direct container port is not reachable from the public internet (tunnel-only ingress)
  - Confirm Cloudflare proxy (orange cloud) is enabled on both DNS records

---

## Phase 5 — AWS Cloud Identity (Parked)

- [ ] Document LDAP bridge config between AWS AD DS (`isaaclab.local`) and Ubuntu osTicket node
- [ ] Validate Tailscale connectivity between AWS nodes and T430

---

## Phase 6 — Nextcloud Subdomain Deployment (`nextcloud.madearlabs.com`)

- [ ] Create a dedicated `projects/nextcloud/docker-compose.yml` stack
  - Use `nextcloud:latest` image with a persistent named volume (`nextcloud_data`)
  - Back with a `mariadb:10.11` (or `postgres:16`) data container and named volume (`nextcloud_db`)
  - Source all DB credentials from `.env` — no cleartext secrets in compose file
  - Attach both containers to `lab-isolated-net` as `external: true`
- [ ] Add Cloudflare Zero Trust tunnel rule mapping `nextcloud.madearlabs.com` → internal Nextcloud container port
- [ ] Harden Nextcloud config (`config/config.php`)
  - Set `'trusted_domains'` to include `nextcloud.madearlabs.com`
  - Set `'overwriteprotocol' => 'https'` and `'overwrite.cli.url'`
- [ ] Remove any direct UFW port exposure once tunnel is live
- [ ] Validate end-to-end: Nextcloud login page loads at `https://nextcloud.madearlabs.com`
- [ ] Capture `docker network inspect lab-isolated-net` screenshot as network proof



---

## Phase 7 — Notes Ingress (Upcoming)
> Self-hosted FOSS notes app (SilverBullet) exposed at `notes.madearlabs.com`

- [ ] Add a `silverbullet` service to the compose stack
      (`ghcr.io/silverbulletmd/silverbullet:latest`)
- [ ] Mount a named volume `sb_data` at `/space` for note/markdown persistence
- [ ] Attach to `lab-isolated-net` with **no host port exposure** (web UI on internal :3000)
- [ ] Set basic auth via `SB_USER` (`user:pass`) sourced from `.env` — no cleartext in Git
- [ ] Add public hostname `notes.madearlabs.com` → `http://silverbullet:3000`
      as a Cloudflare Zero Trust tunnel rule (reuse the existing `cf_tunnel` agent)
- [ ] Validate end-to-end: container healthy → `notes.madearlabs.com` loads over HTTPS

---

## Phase 8 — Portfolio Evidence Capture & Organization (Upcoming)
> Screenshot proof of completed projects for the portfolio site.
> Images live under `docs/portfolio/<project>/` — scrub secrets before committing.

- [ ] **01 — Hardened Base OS:** `sudo ufw status verbose` (22/80/8080 rules) + `uptime` showing headless run
- [ ] **02 — WordPress + MySQL:** browser at `wp.madearlabs.com`; `docker logs wp_database` showing "ready for connections"; `docker network inspect lab-isolated-net`; `docker ps` with stack up
- [ ] **03 — Cloudflare Tunnel:** Zero Trust dashboard showing tunnel HEALTHY; `docker logs cf_tunnel` with registered connections; public HTTPS padlock
- [ ] **04 — Caddy + DNS-01 TLS:** `casa.madearlabs.com` padlock + cert details; `systemctl status caddy`; journal line confirming cert issued
- [x] **05 — Tailscale Mesh:** `tailscale status` showing all four nodes
- [ ] **06 — GPG Signing:** pinentry prompt mid-commit over SSH; `git log --show-signature` with "Good signature"
- [ ] Commit scrubbed images under `docs/portfolio/<project>/` (no tokens, passwords, or full Tailscale IPs)
- [ ] Publish `docs/portfolio/README.md` index with thumbnail links

---

## Phase 9 — SSH Hardening (Security / Pending Apply)
> Triggered by failed login attempts from `127.0.0.1` using identity-derived
> usernames. Runbook: `docs/portfolio/07-ssh-hardening/README.md`

- [x] Confirm key-based login works over Tailscale **before** disabling passwords
- [x] Disable password auth: `PasswordAuthentication no` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/10-hardening.conf` (`sshd -t` then restart)
- [x] Scope port 22 to the mesh: replace broad `22/tcp` UFW rule with `allow in on tailscale0 to any port 22 proto tcp`
- [x] Verify: password auth refused, `systemctl status ssh` still `active (running)`
- [ ] (If recurs) capture the local client PID during a burst: `sudo ss -tnp | grep 127.0.0.1:22` → `ps -fp <PID>`
- [ ] Capture evidence screenshots into `docs/portfolio/07-ssh-hardening/` and flip status to Complete

---

## Phase 10 — Recipe Manager Ingress (Upcoming)
> Self-hosted recipe manager (Mealie) exposed at `recipes.madearlabs.com`

- [ ] Create a dedicated `projects/mealie/docker-compose.yml` stack
      (`ghcr.io/mealie-recipes/mealie:latest`)
- [ ] Mount a named volume `mealie_data` at `/app/data` for recipe/image persistence
- [ ] Attach to `lab-isolated-net` as `external: true` with **no host port exposure** (web UI on internal :9000)
- [ ] Source config from `.env` (`TZ`, `BASE_URL`, `ALLOW_SIGNUP=false`) and add a `.env.example` with placeholders — no cleartext in Git
- [ ] Set a memory limit on the container (T430 CPU/RAM guardrail)
- [ ] Add public hostname `recipes.madearlabs.com` → `http://mealie:9000`
      as a Cloudflare Zero Trust tunnel rule (reuse the existing `cf_tunnel` agent)
- [ ] First login: change the default admin credentials immediately, then create household user accounts
- [ ] Validate end-to-end: container healthy → `recipes.madearlabs.com` loads over HTTPS
- [ ] Capture `docker network inspect lab-isolated-net` screenshot as network proof
- [ ] Add Mealie data volume to the S3 backup plan

---

## Standing Maintenance Checklist

- [ ] GPG signing active: `export GPG_TTY=$(tty)` before any commit session over SSH
- [ ] Confirm all new stacks join `lab-isolated-net` as `external: true`
- [ ] No cleartext secrets in any Git-tracked file
